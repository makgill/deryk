```
If you want a warâ€¦

I will do 2 years of no trade. Nothing.

In the war, no coin can trade.

If you want ABC, you want shitcoins, welcome to bankruptcy.

It was nice knowing you.

Bitcoin will die before ABC shits on it. I will see BCH trade at 0 for a few years. Will you?

Side with ABC, you hate bitcoin, you are my enemy. You have no fucking idea what that means.

You will.

I AM Satoshi. Have a nice life. You will now discover me when pissed off.

And so. You could have had proof. Your choice.

Fuck you,
Craig
