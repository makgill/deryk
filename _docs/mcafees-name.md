@hitney_ouston: Just so you know John ("mister McAfee" sounds dorky, dishonest, and quasi-derogatory), speaking form a human perspective more

John: It is my family name. I am more proud of my Irish name and heritage than anything else on this earth. And if someone considers me a dork, then they have never Googled me. I have been in jail in 31 different countries. I have 49 children. I have lived with seven women silmultaneously in the same house for over two years (I do not advise it). I have been accused of murder,
have been an international fugitive three times. I am a weapons expert, have a pilot's license for up to a 300 foot tanker, I am 72 and currently, have been married to a 35 year old black woman who was a prostitute when I met her. If my name sounds dorky, I promise you there is not a man, woman or child on this planet who would consider me a dork. In fact, I have made the name "McAfee" one of the coolest names on the planet. Still, you are entitled to your opinion.
