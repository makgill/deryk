excerpt: An anthology of the funniest (wackiest) quotes from Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. Presented with no ill will and only good cheer towards our Catholic friend.

This "anthology" is not meant to shame Luke Dashjr or otherwise incite any actions towards him whatsoever. As far as I can see, Luke is actually a nice person, a good father, and an excellent coder (despite having insane economic ideas about Bitcoin). People should not be punished for wrong-think. Learn to laugh instead at these quotes with good charity towards the possibility of nuance that doesn't come through.

*Seriously. Don't harass people for wrong opinions. Lighten up a bit. Ignore them, laugh, or simply appreciate those people for the good things they do despite their bad ideas.*

"No, usury is still immoral and slavery is still moral or immoral in the same conditions as it always was." ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/44jj4y/i_went_to_catholic_schools_from_preschool_to/czqw8tw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

"Religious liberty is applicable only to Catholicism; separation of Church and State is condemned heresy. Neither of those have changed."

"The condoned slavery is still moral (unless prohibited by law, in which case it's the sin of disobedience)." ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/44jj4y/i_went_to_catholic_schools_from_preschool_to/czqwmje?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

"By the way, the Sun really orbits the Earth, not vice-versa." ([source](http://forums3.armagetronad.net/viewtopic.php?t=19038))

"It is legitimate to punish by death, someone who openly declares the popes to not be infallible on matters of faith and morals (other than pagans)." ([source](https://gist.github.com/AgoristRadio/5803075))

"The only religion people have a right to practice is Catholicism. Other religions should not exist. Nobody has any right to practice false religions. Martin Luther was a servant of Satan. He ought to have been put to death. Slavery is not immoral. Sodomy should be punishable by death." ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/492ztl/lukejr_the_only_religion_people_have_a_right_to/)) 

"The most clear example (IMO) is on the topic of freedom of religion. The Church has taught that not only is it wrong to follow false religions, but that the States have a moral duty to suppress them, and can only be justified in a tolerance of them for a greater good (and in no circumstance can it be justified for the State to treat them as a right or on equal footing with the true religion). Vatican II (as interpreted by the modernist magisterium incl antipopes) on the other hand teaches that people by their nature have a right to practice any religion they choose, and that States must enshrine this as a civil right. But this is just the tip of the iceberg..."

"The ideal king would not permit heretics to preach or worship openly (including appropriate censorship of condemned literature), and would proscribe execution for those who did so after warning and jail time (including if they preached while in jail). Catholic clergy's right to be judged only by their peers (other clergy, never laymen) would of course be respected."
