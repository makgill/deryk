Of course it was Bitcoin Cash. 

The man accused of stealing a military armored vehicle in Virginia on Tuesday and joyriding it 60 miles before being arrested is passionate about more than just living his life a quarter-mile at a time. A quick glance at his Twitter account also shows him to be a Bitcoin Cash evangelist. 

That's right, he's all about what Bitcoin Cash supporters (and practically no one else — even Amazon's Alexa has dunked on Bitcoin Cash)  insist is the "real bitcoin."   

You may have caught video of the chase on social media. It was quite a thing to behold.

According to the Associated Press, the man accused of stealing the vehicle from the National Guard base at Fort Pickett in Blackstone is none other than the 29-year-old Joshua Philip Yabut. The AP also reports that Yabut was tweeting before the incident. 

```
"tryna explain to my gf why i support bitcoin cash (the holiest chain)"
```

"Hours before the vehicle drove off the base, an account confirmed by the Guard as Yabut's tweeted a Wikipedia entry about the M113 armored personnel carrier, which is similar to the M577 vehicle police chased, and a screenshot of a map around the area where the vehicle eventually stopped," notes the AP report. "He wrote a series of odd tweets Tuesday, including: 'where is this damn water buffalo' 'all i wanna do is get an anime wife' and 'wow I think I just discovered a large illegal spy operation in the us government.'"

Let's take a look at what appears to be his Twitter account.

And just so you know we're not trying to pin these hijinks on an innocent BCH fan, here are a bunch of the tweets the AP says were confirmed by the National Guard to have come from his account.

A quick glance through the account shows that Yabut had more on his mind than anime wives. Specifically, that aforementioned sweet sweet Bitcoin Cash.

```

And this wasn't just some passing fancy. While a lot of his Bitcoin Cash-specific tweets were from late 2017, he still has "BCH" — the abbreviation for Bitcoin Cash — in his Twitter name. 

Thankfully, no one was reported injured in the roughly two-hour chase, and Yabut was safely taken into custody. 

His legal fate, however, remains unclear — much like the long-term prospects for his beloved BCH.
