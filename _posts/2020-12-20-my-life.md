# How to Delete Your Dox From MyLife.com

[MyLife.com](https://www.mylife.com/) is doxxing you and millions of people. Don't believe me? Type your name into the [search](https://www.mylife.com/)
and you'll likely find that all sorts of information you don't want public is just a few clicks away.

Scared? Annoyed? You should be. The good news is that you can make MyLife delete this information. The bad news is that after telling several friends about this they all encountered issues
with MyLife "customer" support which made it difficult to take the information down. In the interest of helping people
protect their privacy better in these strange times, I thought I'd share the email exchange I had that resulted in success. 

The first email is an autoreply to the form I filed on their website.

Annoying. I told them to delete it, so they should have just deleted it. I visited the [FAQ](https://archive.is/7CbpB) to see if I could handle this without talking to a rep, and though I no longer have the exact text at the time I made this request, here is the current text:

>You can have your Reputation Profile removed after providing identity verification. We do not honor third party removal requests. The owner of the profile has to directly request removal through MyLife.com®. To begin that process, you must be a registered member and logged in. Click here to begin.

This is where most people stop and where I almost did too, because who wants to give the doxxers more personal information and *register* an account with them in order to have it taken down? That's sort of like an old-school Al Capone mob protection agreement. I wasn't going to do that, and luckily it's all bullsh<span>*t</span>. I figured we can call their bluff, so I replied again in no uncertain terms that they need to take it down at once and that I was not going to create an account.

No that is unacceptable. I should not have to create an account to delete 
private information. Delete it immediately.
```

Now an agent replies to me and...success! She deletes it without me having to verify myself or create an account. I was correct. Don't let formal policies intimidate you. Tell them what they're going to do and don't give them another option.

What amazes me though is that she tells me that the information on the page could be found with a simple Google search. I figured she was lying, so I run a
"simple" Google search and the only thing I can find is the information on MyLife which ranks quite high on the search. I run a "complex" Google search,
and then a series of them, and again all I can easily find is the MyLife profile page.

It appears to me that the only reason the information was easy to find with a simple Google search is because MyLife posted it!  So while it's true the public *can* technically find the information, it's also true that it's MyLife who made it much easier for any random person to find it with an easy search and a couple clicks without my knowledge or consent. That's not okay. People can get [hurt](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/2020/08/03/judge-salas-releases-statement-north-brunswick-shooting/5570934002/) when their addresses are easily available online.
