# Bitcoin Opsec Rant

You bought Bitcoin a while ago and now you're starting to get rich. Good for you. You had the foresight to see where this thing was
really going and the will to act on it despite the [haters](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/) and the scammers. Unfortunately that's the only good news I have for you because chances are you're going to be <span>f*cked</span> unless you start taking your opsec seriously. It might already be too late but if it's not, here's what you need to do.

- STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH BITCOIN YOU OWN. There are way too many of you who are like a house dog prancing around the hunk of meat he found to a pack of wild starving coyotes. You've put a target on your back for IRS demons, scammers, Russian mobsters, disgruntled envious peasants and worse. Sure, in the past, you weren't a target because maybe you didn't have a lot of Bitcoin. But soon, a very few Bitcoin might be worth *a lot* of money. You need to understand that there is effectively no price ceiling on something like this. Everyone who owns Bitcoin before a [hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/) event is a [target](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks) after.

- Make yourself look poor! Better to pretend you don't have much Bitcoin after all. Even better to have never talked about Bitcoin at all but we all made that mistake, so maybe you once had some Bitcoin that you bought on an exchange, but you spent most of it or [lost](https://twitter.com/FukNoCoiners/status/1340085207139897344) it when your laptop fell off your friend's boat on July 4th. The gains other people are bragging about are not yours. You. Missed. Out. You need to start making records and documenting this stuff now so that you have proof of this. [Plant breadcrumbs](https://twitter.com/marttimalmi/status/1339908801349230592) you can point to later when the IRS agents come after you. Email friends or fake accounts you set up yourself lamenting the loss of your coins. Do it before everyone else does. Do it in a unique way and don't share how you did it because the ruse is up when everyone else copies you. Give up some of your bragging rights for your personal safety and protecitng your new wealth from the criminals in government and out who want to steal it. And don't talk about how you did it.

- Get serious about your [digital privacy.](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/) You need to lay the foundations for online privacy when you don't think you need it because it will be too late when you do. Delete your home address from public databases. See if you've been [pwned.](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) Delete old [accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/how-roger-ver-hacked-what-he-did-stop-it) on services you no longer use.
Scrub personal information from the web you carelessly shared over the years. There will be people combing through old archives in not a long time from now to find people to target. Wipe out archives like Wayback too if you can. And don't assume your existing psuedonyms will help you. Most people using psuedonyms give way too much information about themselves online even when they don't realise they're doing it. Unless you've worked on projects deanonmizing people, trust me, you don't understand how easy it is to do with just the smallest, seemingly insigificant clues left by people. Besides, you better believe there will be [subpoenas](https://www.gwern.net/docs/sr/2015-03-30-gwern-redditsubpoena.html) one day against Twitter, Reddit, email accounts, etc that are bragging about holding large amounts of Bitcoin. You probably weren't careful enough to guarantee these services don't have a lot of important personal information on you. And don't talk about how you did it.

- Secure your devices and accounts. Actually do it. Don't say you're going to do it tomorrow, or "later." Do it now. 2FA everything. Get some damn good passwords and secure email addresses you never share for account registrations. Get an extra phone number and never give it out to anyone. And don't talk about how you did it.

- Secure your Bitcoin. Unless you have a good reason, get it off exchanges and custodial services. That's an opportunity for hack or seizure. DELETE THE SCREENSHOTS YOU LAZILY TOOK OF YOUR PRIVATE KEYS OR THE COPY AND PASTE YOU KEEP IN YOUR NOTES APP. You know you did it. Don't wait on this or you're going to become another sob story. We've all seen them over the years. You're next if you don't get on this. And don't talk about how you did it.

This is not a definitive guide. It's a slap in the face and a bucket of cold water. It is not advice, it is exhortation. You need to do your own research about everything you may need to do to secure your life and your wealth. And one last time, you need to NEVER talk about how you did it. Telling people what you did to make yourself safe is like telling people about the secret underwater tunnel into your castle. What security looks like will be different for everyone but it is very important that you do it. Please do not wait. And don't talk about how you did it.
