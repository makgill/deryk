You bought Bitcoin a while ago and now you're rich. Good for you. You had the foresight to see where this thing was
really going and the will to act on it. Unfortunately that's the only good news I have for you because chances are you're f*cked.

Do I have your attention? This is part one of a two part guide. Part one explains how to stop yourself from getting f*cked in the first place or stop making the same mistakes
you've been making all along. Part two will attempt to explain how to unf*ck yourself.

It was one thing in the past when your Bitcoin Barons were the rare group who were rich for possesing several thousand Bitcoin. It's quite another
when every random idiot you talked to on Twitter who owned between 1 and 10 Bitcoin suddenly has a sizeable fortune too. We've probably
seen nothing yet.
