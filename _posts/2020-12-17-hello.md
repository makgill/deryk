# Hello again, world!

I'm writing again. It's been a long time since I've written consistenty and my output for two years has been maybe a dozen hastily written articles, a couple of which nevertheless enjoyed their [15 seconds](https://www.ccn.com/cryptos-big-tax-drama-cant-stop-bitcoin-cash-surge/) of fame and one which even became a bit of a meme. Still, I've missed writing regularly and can't deny I've failed spectacularly at most of the writing goals I tried to set for myself.
