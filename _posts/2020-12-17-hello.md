# Hello again, world!

I'm writing again. It's been a long time since I've written consistenty and my output for two years has been maybe a dozen hastily written articles, a couple of which nevertheless enjoyed their [fifteen seconds](https://www.ccn.com/cryptos-big-tax-drama-cant-stop-bitcoin-cash-surge/) of fame and one which even became a bit of a [meme](https://twitter.com/deadalnix/status/1221639291882917888) passed around by a group of Bitcoin developers who blamed me in part for disrupting their funding source.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Still, I've missed writing regularly and can't deny I've failed spectacularly at most of the writing goals I tried to set for myself.

I hope to start changing that today and make 2021 a better writing year. No, I don't know what I'm going to write about. People seem to still like when I write about Bitcoin and I know I have a few things left to say on that, so you can expect that. I've also been doing more unpublished short stories lately which will all be shared here. Besides that, I'm going to leave it open. I had thought of doing some kind of "seasonal" approach to writing, where I go deep into one topic per season, but right now I don't want to commmit to anything other than writing and publishing frequently on anything I'm interested in or which the few readers who remain from my "popular" days in 2018 want me to write about. 

What I do know is that I'm fascinated by Gwern Branwen's idea of a [long site](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site). Gwern asks on his site: "What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started now?" I'm working on my own answers to this question, but I like the approach he [recommends,](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site) which is to "write perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to time," as opposed to commiting to writing finely polished essays all the time. To have almost everything I write or create here improve with time (and regular editing and updating) like good wine or cheese rather than spinning the hamster wheel of write-it-and-forget-it blog posts that I feel I've often done in the past.

This is easier said than done, obviously, and I don't doubt that most of the work I do will be very *short* indeed, but I like Gwern's model as an ideal to push towards.

<sup id="fn1"></sup>[1] In truth they have nobody to blame but themselves for failing to raise funds in Bitcoin Cash, and while I disagreed with much of what they had proposed, I did my best to [guide](https://read.cash/@Bitcoin.com/bitcoincoms-clarifications-on-the-miner-development-fund-80828a53) the [discussion](https://read.cash/@Bitcoin.com/update-on-developer-funding-83695ebc) to a more productive place by leaving what I thought were obvious hints in some writing I did at the time. I'll tell that story one day. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">[return]</a>
