This is my attempt to prevent the kind of watered-down academic history of Bitcoin that will no-doubt be written by chronicling content and events that are so shameful they're funny.

### [It only took 37 seconds for two bitcoin 'celebs' to start fighting on a cruise ship](https://makgill.github.io/bitcoin-shame/coinsbank)

A ridiculous man in a cowboy hat and a debate at a pool party on a hot Barcelona day. What could go wrong?

### [Bitcoin Cash evangelist accused of joyriding stolen armored vehicle in Virginia](https://makgill.github.io/bitcoin-shame/tank)

Of course it was Bitcoin Cash.

### [You will now discover me when pissed off](https://makgill.github.io/bitcoin-shame/abc)

How drunk was Craig Wright when he wrote this?

### [Please send the contact information for your legal council](https://makgill.github.io/bitcoin-shame/please-send-contact)
