*"Usury is still immoral and slavery is still moral or immoral in the same conditions as it always was." â€” Luke Dashjr, Bitcoin Core Developer*


## WTF is this?

This is my attempt to prevent the kind of watered-down academic history of Bitcoin that will no-doubt be written by chronicling content and events that are so shameful they're funny.

{% assign bitcoinhumour = site.bitcoinhumour | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
{% for bitcoinhumour in bitcoinhumour %}

<div class="h-entry note post-stub">
 
 
 <h3 class="post-stub"><a href="{{ bitcoinhumour.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
  {{ bitcoinhumour.title }}
      
   </a> ({{ bitcoinhumour.sourcedate }}) </h3>
 
 <p class="p-content"> {{ bitcoinhumour.excerpt }}
 </p>
 
</div>

{% endfor %}
