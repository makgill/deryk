# Bitcoin Humour File

<p class="notebox">Originally posted on 15 December 2020. Updated frequently. Idea borrowed from <a href="http://milk.com/wall-o-shame/">Milk.com's Wall'o'Shame</a>. Support the work <a href="https://makgill.github.io/deryk/support">here.</a></p> 

*"Usury is still immoral and slavery is still moral or immoral in the same conditions as it always was." â€” [Luke Dashjr](https://makgill.github.io/deryk/bitcoin/humour/lukoos-nest/), Bitcoin Core Developer*


## WTF is this?

This is my attempt to prevent the kind of watered-down academic history of Bitcoin that will no-doubt be written by chronicling content and events that are so shameful, wacky, sad or awesome that they're a little funny (in a dark or light way) to look back on.

## How do I support it?

Share the content, [send me](https://makgill.github.io/deryk/contact) new material to save, or [tip me](https://makgill.github.io/deryk/support) in Bitcoin. Thank you!

{% assign bitcoinhumour = site.bitcoinhumour | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
{% for bitcoinhumour in bitcoinhumour %}

<div class="h-entry note post-stub">
 
 
 <h3 class="post-stub"><a href="{{ bitcoinhumour.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
  {{ bitcoinhumour.title }}



   </a>      {%- if bitcoinhumour.sourcedate -%} ({{ bitcoinhumour.sourcedate }}) {%- endif -%} </h3>
  
 <p class="p-content"> {{ bitcoinhumour.excerpt }}
 </p>
 
</div>

{% endfor %}
