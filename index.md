## Bitcoin and Cypherpunk Antropology

### [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](/) (1997-2001)

Probably the most popular thing I've written. It's in demand in a lot of different forms, so I've given it its own subsite. 

### [Shame File](/) (1998)

My original February 1998 call to the community, issued immediately after the Netscape breakthrough, to start using the term open source'. This is the beginning that OSI and the mainstreaming of Linux built on.

### [Open Source Summit](/) (1998)

And this is what followed, when the chieftains of the hacker tribes met and threw their weight behind "open source".

### [Keeping an Open Mind](/) (1999)

An essay on Open Source I wrote for the Cyberian Express, a Barnes & Noble newsletter.

### [Response to Nikolai Bezroukov](/) (1999)

I dissect a really bad article in First Monday that billed itself as a "Critique of Pure Raymondism".

### [The Case of the Quake Cheats](/) (1999)

After the Quake 1 source was GPLed, John Carmack reported that the release had enabled some cheats. Does this mean open source is a security problem? In this essay, I discuss the security lessons of Quake.

### [Guest Editorial: World Domination](/) (2001)

Because some visions are too audacious not to approached with a sence of humor.

### [Telling Lies: ESR on Microsoft](/) (2001)

A senior Microsoft executive is telling lies in public. In other startling news, the sky is blue and water has been seen flowing downhill.

### [Culture Hacking](/) (2012)

My talk at AgileCultureCon on culture-hacking and linguistic maps.
