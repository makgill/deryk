When I'm not being a hacker, I'm often a writer. Here are some of the screeds I've uttered over the years.

# Open Source and Hacker Anthropology:

## [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](cathedral-bazaar/) (1997-2001)

Probably the most popular thing I've written. It's in demand in a lot of different forms, so I've given it its own subsite. Includes <cite>Homesteading the Noosphere</cite>, <cite>The Magic Cauldron</cite>, and <cite>A Brief History of Hackerdom</cite>.

## [Goodbye free software; hello, open source](/~esr/open-source.html) (1998)

My original February 1998 call to the community, issued immediately after the Netscape breakthrough, to start using the term open source'. This is the beginning that OSI and the mainstreaming of Linux built on.

## [Open Source Summit](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918) (1998)

And this is what followed, when the chieftains of the hacker tribes met and threw their weight behind "open source".

## [Keeping an Open Mind](openmind.html) (1999)

An essay on Open Source I wrote for the Cyberian Express, a Barnes & Noble newsletter.

## [Response to Nikolai Bezroukov](response-to-bezroukov.html) (1999)

I dissect a really bad article in First Monday that billed itself as a "Critique of Pure Raymondism".

## [The Case of the Quake Cheats](quake-cheats.html) (1999)

After the Quake 1 source was GPLed, John Carmack reported that the release had enabled some cheats. Does this mean open source is a security problem? In this essay, I discuss the security lessons of Quake.

## [Guest Editorial: World Domination](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3676) (2001)

Because some visions are too audacious not to approached with a sence of humor.

## [Telling Lies: ESR on Microsoft](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5007) (2001)

A senior Microsoft executive is telling lies in public. In other startling news, the sky is blue and water has been seen flowing downhill.

## [Culture Hacking](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Culture-hacking-Open-Source) (2012)

My talk at AgileCultureCon on culture-hacking and linguistic maps.

## [A Fan of Freedom](rms-bio.html) (2003)

Some thoughts on Sam Williams's excellent biography of Richard Stallman.

## [The Prudential interview](prudential.html) (2003)

A transcript of my 15 October 2003 conference call with some big-time Prudential Securities investors. If you're looking for an example of how to do effective advocacy to a business audience, this interview is representative of how I do it.

## [Hacking and Refactoring](hacking-and-refactoring.html) (2003)

An essay examining the convergence between open source and agile programming.

## [Open letter to Sun: Let Java Go](let-java-go.html) (2004)

At Sun's February 2004 meeting, CEO Scott McNealy said "The open-source model is our friend". This is the open letter I wrote to urge him to demonstrate that.

## [The Luxury of Ignorance: An Open-Source Horror Story](cups-horror.html) (2004)

The biggest obstacle between open-source software and world domination is not Microsoft, it's our own endemic cluelessness about how to design software that won't make nontechnical users run screaming. I ran into a particularly poignant example when I tried to configure CUPS for remote printing. A glitzy GUI interface fails to compensate for some astonishing blunders. There are lessons here for other projects.

## [The Luxury of Ignorance: Part Deux](luxury-part-deux.html) (2004)

A followup to <cite>The Luxury of Ignorance: An Open-Source Horror Story</cite> in which I discuss the community reaction, develop the concept of the luxury of ignorance further, and call for a sea-change in attitudes towards UI.

## [Samizdat: Stinks on Ice](samizdat-response.html) (2004)

I offered the Alexis de Toqueville instutute a private critique of their book on the supposed theft at the heart of the Linux operating system, in the fond hope that they would correct the errors. They didn't. Here it is.

## [<q>Free Hardware</q>: a Trojan Horse?](free-hardware.html) (2004)

In early 2004 Sun Microsystems and Microsoft started talking up a vision of the future in which hardware would come <q>free</q> with software subscriptions. This essay makes clear why this offer is a dangerous trap.

## [Terminology Wars: A Web Content Analysis](terminology/) (2004)

Who use the terms "open source" and "free software"? What is their relative frequency on the Web? Among developers? In media? This paper has the answers.

## [Open Minds, Open Sources](analog.html) (2004)

My article on open source development that apppeared in the June-July 2004 issue of <cite>Analog</cite> magazine. Focuses on some ideas from complexity theory and on connections with the SF tradition.

## [World Domination 201](world-domination/world-domination-201.html) (2008)

This paper, written with Rob Landley, explains why 2008 is a deadline for popular Linux acceptance on the desktop, and examines the strategy and tactics necessary to achieve that.

In which I discourse on open-source economixs, net neutrality, and all manner of related things.

A comprehensive essay on the design of GPSD, which I believe has significant lessons for other projects.

## [Building The Perfect Box (1996)](lj-howtobuild/)

## [Why Python?](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3882) (2000)

## [The Ultimate Linux Box 2001](ultimate-linux-box/) (2001)

This article is a sequel to my 1996 "Building the Perfect Box" article. Where that was a guide to building Linux workstations on the cheap, this examines a slightly different question: What do you build when money is no object? A severely truncated version edited down to about 25% of its length, appeared in the November 2001 Linux Journal.

## [DRAG.NET](dragnet/) (2002)

A technical presentation on Windows-to-Linux end-user migration that is also a cheesy vaudeville routine -- performed at the Winter 2002 LinuxWorld with Rob Landley and Catherine Raymond.

# Science

## [The Myth of Man The Killer](killer-myth.html)

Most people believe that human beings are uniquily violent animals, natural-born killers. This belief is not only wrong, it prevents clear thinking about the actual causes and mechanisms of violence. In this essay I show that our original sin is not murderousness but _obedience_

## [The Biology of Human Promiscuity](promiscuity.html)

Why does love got to hurt so bad? Or, to put it another way, why aren't humans wired to mate faithfully for life, like swans? An essay in evolutionary psychology.

## [The Utility of Mathematics](utility-of-math/)

An essay, originally written for the Extropians list, on why mathematical formal systems are so mysteriously applicable to the real world.

# Science Fiction

## [Raymond's Reviews](/~esr/sfreviews/)

From 1990 to 1992 I wrote and posted to USENET an SF review column which became rather popular. I still get questions about it, so I've made the reviews available on the Web here.

## [SF Words and Prototype Worlds](/~esr/sf-words/essay.html)

An essay on how readers understand science fiction.

## [A Political History of SF](sf-history.html)

The largest pattern in the history of modern science fiction has been the four failed revolutions against Campbellian hard SF. In this essay I examine the roots of these revolutions and the reasons for their failure.

## [Decentralism Against Terrorism](against-terrorism.html)

A few hours after the destruction of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, some friends asked me to speak out against the worst long-term damage it could mean for our country -- not the terrorism itself, but our political reaction to it.

## [The Anti-Idiotarian Manifesto](/~esr/aim/)

My attempt to distill a lot of post-2001 talking and thinking in the blogosphere into a coherent set of principles and guides to action. A declaration of war on terrorism and the friends of terrorism.

## [Collateral Damage: Reflections on Timothy McVeigh](reflections-on-mcveigh.html)

Timothy McVeigh raises moral questions we seem ill-prepared to answer. Perhaps that's why there's a media rush to turn him into a demon?

## [Why I Am An Anarchist](anarchist.html)

On August 19, 1934, 90% of the German people -- educated citizens of a modern constitutional democracy -- voted Adolf Hitler dictatorial power over their country. In this essay, I explore the stark and terrible implications of this fact.

## [Whatever became of "Civil Rights"?](racism.html)

I wrote this around 1990 after a particularly outrageous series of newspaper stories. The <cite>Philadelphia Inquirer</cite> published an edited version as an Op-Ed piece in "Community Voices" on Sunday, February 8 1998\.

## [Why Libertarians Should Not Love Bill Gates](libgates.html)

The DOJ lawsuit against Microsoft seems to have thrown a good many libertarians into confusion. In this essay, I argue that friends of the free market should condemn both antitrust law _and_ Microsoft.

## [Five Myths Of New Media](fivemyths.html)

I wrote this in April 1997 for a newsletter called "Editorial Eye" targeted for writers and editors.

## [Why "High Art" is in Deep Trouble](arts.html)
