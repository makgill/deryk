title: One Flew Over the Lukoo's Nest
excerpt: An anthology of the funniest (wackiest) quotes from Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. Presented with no ill will and only good cheer towards our Catholic friend.

This "anthology" is not meant to shame Luke Dashjr or otherwise incite any actions towards him whatsoever. As far as I can see, Luke is actually a nice person, a good father, and an excellent coder (despite having insane economic ideas about Bitcoin). People should not be punished for wrong-think. Learn to laugh instead at these quotes with good charity towards the possibility of nuance that doesn't come through.

"No, usury is still immoral and slavery is still moral or immoral in the same conditions as it always was." ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/44jj4y/i_went_to_catholic_schools_from_preschool_to/czqw8tw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

"It is legitimate to punish by death, someone who openly declares the popes to not be infallible on matters of faith and morals (other than pagans)." ([source](https://gist.github.com/AgoristRadio/5803075))

"The only religion people have a right to practice is Catholicism. Other religions should not exist. Nobody has any right to practice false religions. Martin Luther was a servant of Satan. He ought to have been put to death. Slavery is not immoral. Sodomy should be punishable by death."
