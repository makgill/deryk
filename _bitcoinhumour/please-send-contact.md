```
As I previously warned, if you or your staff continued to post
untruthful and malicious defamation about me I would take legal action
against you and your companies.

I see you have again posted an outrageously untrue claim that I
engaged in unlawful and unethical behavior, relying on your
privileged position as moderator of the subreddit to fraudulently
convince others of the truthfulness of these untrue claims.

You should retain all records, communications to myself and 
these claims with your staff and any other parties, as if you destroy
theem it will work against your interest in discovery.

I regret that it has come to this, but your continued violence against
me offers me no alternative.
