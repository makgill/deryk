The best we can come to if you absolutely need real-time communication would 
be #bitcoin-assets on Freenode. (You can connect via http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-assets 
in your browser if you do not have a client). I'm usually around.

Bar that, there's nothing a call can carry that a letter wouldn't carry as
well, is there ?

All the best,
Mircea Popescu

I'm unable to connect to freenode so email will have to do for now.

As part of our investigation of SatoshiDICE, we would like to request that MPEx 
voluntarily provide certain documents to us: (1) a list of all SatoshiDICE shareholders 
prior to the sale of the company in July 2013(preferably by name, address, or BTC 
address); and (2) an account history for Mr. Erik Voorhees showing the sale of 
shares, payment of dividends etc.

Does MPEx have such documents and would you be willing to provide them to the staff?

Thank you,
Daphna Waxman

In general, MPEx maintains a vast outreach program intended to help members of the 
general public understand the topics involved in this novel field. MPEx also complies 
with all legal requests.

So far our relationship is of the first kind, so inasmuch as you'd need help with any 
particular topic please feel free to ask. Inasmuch as you're soliciting private information 
you will have to sufficiently establish your authority to do so, which includes defeating 
specific challenges of jurisdiction that on a cursory examination seem to bar the institution 
you claim to be associated with from making these specific requests.

So far all we have is an email address, something which is spoofed on a regular basis - 
I get numerous notices of various sorts each week purporting to come from all sorts of banks
and other institutions I've never had any relationship with, for instance.

All the best,
Mircea Popescu

I'm happy to provide any additional information that would verify who I am and my 
association. Also, feel free to search my name on the Internet and call my office 
phone number to listen to my voice mail message or the SEC's front desk at (212-336-1100) 
and ask to be connected to my line.

Perhaps we misunderstand each other. Should you wish to establish your authority on the 
matter you would have to present all of :

a) the legal basis upon which the SEC is investigating a Bitcoin enterprise, whichever 
that may be. This would customarily come in the form of an Act of Congress specifically 
authorising the SEC to review MMORPGs and online activities involving such computer games 
and their virtual currencies, be they WoW gold, Linden Dollars, EVE Isk, Bitcoin, etc and 
so forth. Absent that, it may come in the form of a court ruling - definitive and irrevocable 
or whatever the equivalent of that may be at common law - judging the SEC has such authority. 
This, of course, is a thornier issue.

b) the authority upon which the SEC is making requests of personally identifying information 
from me specifically, which would necessarily include solid grounding in both Romanian and EU 
law.

c) the authority you personally have in the matter. This would customarily come in the form of 
an order or other such instrument signed by the officer in charge of your department directing 
you to investigate. Employees of all kinds do indeed often have a phone link in their office, 
but this is entirely irrelevant in this discussion.

Should you understand you have no authority in the matter but nevertheless wish to pursue some 
sort of amicable understanding, you will first have to appreciate the difference between legal 
and illegal requests. In this sense, asking someone to pick up your daughter from school is a 
legal request (as far as I know of the rapidly deteriorating legal environment in the US, at 
any rate). Asking them to pick up your daughter and throw her over a cliff however is an illegal 
request. The difference between these is, broadly speaking, that the party satisfying the first 
type of request exposes themselves to no liability, whereas the party satisfying the second type 
of request does expose themselves, perhaps to significant liability, both civil and criminal.

Secondly, yet perhaps as importantly, you will have to appreciate the fact that MPEx has to date, 
and long before the SEC as much as heard of Bitcoin, pursued with some success if with different 
means roughly the same agenda, which is to say the exposure of scams and the protection of the
general public from scammers of all sorts and types*. In the particular case you brought I must 
confess I have my own suspicions, which I do not necessarily have either the means to verify or 
in any way enforce.

I was from the onset and remain for the indefinite future strongly committed to discouraging 
scams in Bitcoin finance, while nurturing a vibrant, diverse and free marketplace - and this 
commitment engages MPEx as well as a variety of other Bitcoin institutions and groups. It is 
on this basis that I would very much welcome a working relationship with your institution, as
I believe our respective strengths complement each other superbly. Nevertheless, the commitment
to freedom is not merely verbiage, but quite as strong, and on this basis I perceive we may 
encounter difficulties going forward, especially taking into account the confused legal environment
and occasionally misguided political choices coming out of the US.

In the spirit of candor, let me make it perfectly clear that what's being discussed here is nothing 
else and nothing short of the SEC's ultimate relevancy and importance in the Bitcoin space, and so 
far I am not particularly impressed. Let us work together to improve upon this shaky basis if at all 
possible.

All the best,
Mircea Popescu

Dear Mr. Popescu,

I have attached a formal letter requesting that MPEx voluntarily provide certain information and
documentation to the SEC staff. I hope that the information contained in the letter satisfies your
below concerns.

I appreciate your willingness to discuss these important issues and am available to discuss any 
additional questions you may have.

Thank you,

Daphna Waxman

While I appreciate your efforts to qualify for an information exchange agreement with MPEx, as
well as your narrow satisfaction of the response timeline I publicly outlinediii, and while 
these constitute in my estimation significant progress towards building a solid platform upon 
which to further our shared goals, nevertheless substantial hurdles still remain to be overcome
in this process.

As a key step, the commissioners of the SEC are to at their earliest convenience adopt a 
resolution, to be jointly drafted at expert level, which is to include a) a plain statement
of the SEC's lack of jurisdiction with regards to Bitcoin, thus alligning itself with the
position of the US FED and the US GAO ; b) a statement recognising MPEx' regulatory authority 
over Bitcoin finance as a SRO ; c) an appointment of any one of the commissioners as authorised 
Bitcoin liaison, which would include the creation of a dedicated PGP key and a Web of Trust 
membership, which would be recognised as such by MPEx, and on the basis of which all further 
communication is to be conducted, as well as minimal technical provisions for the operation of this
system ; as well as further points as the parties may deem expedient.

This will both provide a solid basis for future, continued cooperation as well as conveniently 
insulate either party from unwelcome legal and technical complexities. Kindly let me know as soon
as you are ready to proceed.

All the best,
Mircea Popescu

In short : Bitcoin is a sovereign. Accepting this matter of fact is a sine qua non prerequisite for playing. No exceptions.
