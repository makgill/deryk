Okay...so I have a funny Bitcoin story for you which I heard from a friend.

A middle-aged couple bought 1 BTC for a 1000 USD recently. They were happy beyond what can be described in words at the good deal they had got. So they got in touch with my friend to ask him about how they could sell it. He sent them the links to various medium articles and blogposts on how to buy and sell bitcoin. The couple got in touch with him again and told him that they had failed to sell the bitcoin. So my friend went and met them. They then "showed" him their bitcoin. It was a plastic coin with the Bitcoin symbol on it!
