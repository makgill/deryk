# The Parable of Bitcoinia

There was a far away town called Bitcoinia, and in Bitcoinia there was a strange phenonoma--all the people of Bitcoinia grew apples but they only had [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/63859l/github_commit_where_satoshi_added_the_block_size/) shared apple cart with which to take their apples to the city market. Now, in the days when Bitcoinia was a tiny village of two or three homes, this had not been a problem because the apple cart had never been full, but now Bitcoinia was a thriving town and the people found that the apple cart would soon be unable to carry anymore apples.

One day a wise man pointed out that the town ought to invest in more apple carts soon before they ran out of space in their only cart. Even just one more cart would allow the people to bring twice the amount of apples to market on each trip. This would surely mean, said the wise man, that the townspeople would be more productive and make more money at the market. And if they didn't do it, he warned, they would soon have apples rotting on the trees that they couldn't take to the maket.

Everyone agreed, and they convened a meeting to discuss how many apple carts to buy. During the meeting, a famous apple theorist named Gregory Maxwell told the townspeople that buying more carts, even buying just one more cart, would be very dangerous for their apple business. If, for example, the town had two apple carts, it would be more expensive to guard their carts from highway bandits, Gregory Maxwell said. He demonstrated this with math the townspeople couldn't understand, and because it made no sense, and because Gregory Maxwell was very smart and had a [PhD,](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/dwuq5rq/) a few of the townspeople agreed with Gregory Maxwell. Most, however, still wanted to buy a new cart.

And so it was that the townspeople sent a man to the market to buy a cart and he went and brought it back. But then something strange happened. The next day, they found that the new apple cart was [broken.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jj2hf/bitcoin_xt_nodes_being_ddosed/) Nobody knew who did it, but some of the townspeople whispered that it might be Gregory Maxwell and his new followers. Another man was sent to the market to get a cart, and again, the following morning, they found the cart broken.

This obviously wouldn't do, so the townspeople convened another meeting to discuss the broken carts. Gregory Maxwell denied breaking the carts, and he again told the people that they did not need another cart anyways. "Where would it end," Gregory Maxwell asked, "if we bought a cart now? Surely we should only have to buy more and more carts later." Gregory showed that one full apple cart at the market at any time was the only way to ensure that the prices of apples didn't collapse and that the apples were safe in transport. Gregory again did a lot of math in front of the people and this time more people agreed with him. Gregory Maxwell promised that he and his scientists were creating a solution to fix the problem, if the townspeople could just be patient.

The wise man sighed and [pointed](http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent) to the town's only apple cart. It was nearly full and was already begining to bend under the weight of the apples. On a very few days, they even had to leave some apples behind to rot. They could not wait for Gregory's complicated solution when they had a very [simple](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157141.msg1758131#msg1758131) one in front of them. He warned that soon there would be other apple farming towns to compete with them if they couldn't bring more apples to the market. And many people agreed with him, though less than before. The townspeople who supported the wise man decided that they would buy a cart on their own, but Gregory Maxwell's supporters said that this was now illegal because they no longer had enough support to make that decision.

The Mayor of Bitcoinia found himself convinced. He passed an order that would [block](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) all further discussion of buying a new apple cart until more people agreed that they wanted to buy one. When a popular apple farmer said that this was obviously impossible, for how could people come to agree on buying a new cart if they couldn't [discuss](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/cu5g3ko) it, Gregory Maxwell's supporters threatened to not now allow this farmer's apples to be [advertised](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/) at the city market if he didn't stop. The farmer sat down.

Thus the town of Bitconia was split in two. Gregory Maxwell and his supporters worked on their new solution to the apple cart problem. The wise man and his supporters continued to try to bring new apple carts into the town, but these were always found [broken](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-classic-targeted-by-ddos-attacks/) no matter how they tried to protect them.

And as the wise man had predicted, some farms moved from Bitcoinia to surrounding towns and began their own [apple farms](https://twitter.com/BraveSampson/status/1257026827643748354) to sell at the market, for there were never enough from Bitcoinia. This angered Gregory Maxwell and his supporters. Didn't these people know that only Bitcoinia apples were worth eating? And while this had more or less been true in the early days of Bitcoinia when they had enough apples for everyone to buy, the town of Bitcoinia simply couldn't meet the demand for their apples anymore.

Another meeting was convened and again, the wise man pointed out that all they needed to do was buy another apple cart. But this time the wise man was kicked out of the meeting, because while everyone was worried about the problem they faced, they were not allowed to discuss buying a new cart. A few people rose in his defense and they were removed from the meeting as well.

Then Gregory Maxwell stood and promised that his solution was almost completed, if only they would be patient. 

And all the while, the apple cart grew fuller and fuller, until it happened that one day, the townspeople had to leave an entire cart's-worth of apples behind to rot because the cart had already been filled. On this day, Gregory Maxwell held a big party to celebrate.
