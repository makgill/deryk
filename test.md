# Explain Bitcoin's Scaling Problem Like I'm Five

There was a far away town called Bitcoinia, and in Bitcoinia there was a strange phenonoma--the people of Bitcoinia grew apples but they only had one apple cart with which to take their apples to the city market. Now, in the days when Bitcoinia was a tiny village of two or three homes, this had not been a problem because the apple cart had never been full, but now Bitcoinia was a thriving town and the people found that the apple cart would soon be unable to carry anymore apples.

One day a wise man pointed out that the town ought to invest in more apple carts soon before they ran out of space in their only cart. Even just one more cart would allow the people to bring twice the amount of apples to market on each trip. This would surely mean, said the wise man, that the townspeople would be more productive and make more money at the market. And if they didn't do it, he warned, they would soon have apples rotting on the trees that they couldn't take to the maket.

Everyone agreed, and they convened a meeting to discuss how many apple carts to buy. During the meeting, a famous apple theorist named Gregory Maxwell told the townspeople that buying more carts, even buying just one more cart, would be very dangerous for their apple business. He demonstrated this with math the townspeople couldn't understand, and because it made no sense, and because Gregory Maxwell was very smart, a few of the townspeople agreed with Gregory Maxwell. Most, however, still wanted to buy a new cart.

And so it was that the townspeople sent a man to the market to buy a cart and he went and brought it back. But then something strange happened. The next day, they found that the new apple cart was broken. Nobody knew who did it, but some of the townspeople whispered that it might be Gregory Maxwell and his new followers. Another man was sent to the market to get a cart, and again, the following morning, they found the cart broken.

This obviously wouldn't do, so the townspeople convened another meeting to discuss the broken carts. Gregory Maxwell denied breaking the carts, and he again told the people that they did not need another cart anyways. "Where would it end," Gregory Maxwell asked, "if we bought a cart now? Surely we should only have to buy more and more carts later." Gregory again did a lot of math in front of the people and this time more people agreed with him. Gregory Maxwell promised that he and his scientists were creating a solution to fix the problem, if the townspeople could just be patient.

The wise man sighed and pointed to the town's only apple cart. It was nearly full and was already begining to bend under the weight of the apples. They could not wait for Gregory's solution. And many people agreed with him, though less than before. It was decided that another
